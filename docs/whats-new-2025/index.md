# What&apos;s New in 2025
{: .no_toc }

This year doesn't have any huge changes, so don't worry about things being too different to what you're used to if you've volunteered with us in the past.

## StreamDeck Changes

Our new recommended setup for the included StreamDeck is [BitFocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion), an industry standard app which lets you control vMix, X-Air, and other tools from a StreamDeck or web browser. Our standard configuration should be preloaded into Companion, but if it's not, or you want to reset everything back to defaults, our standard config can be found in Google Drive under `FiM-AV > Cart Setup > Companion Configs`. Grab the `companionconfig` file for your cart.

## New Camera

We're starting to include new Sony PTZ cameras this year, more details to come soon!

## And More

We're always improving the AV volunteer experience, both during the season and off-season. There may be some additional small changes to equipment or tools.
