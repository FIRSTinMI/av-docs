# What&apos;s New in 2025
{: .no_toc }

This year doesn't have any huge changes, so don't worry about things being too different to what you're used to if you've volunteered with us in the past.

## StreamDeck Changes

Our new recommended setup for the included StreamDeck is [BitFocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion), an industry standard app which lets you control vMix, X-Air, and other tools from a StreamDeck or web browser. Our standard configuration should be preloaded into Companion, but if it's not, or you want to reset everything back to defaults, our standard config can be found in Google Drive under `FiM-AV > Cart Setup > Companion Configs`. Grab the `companionconfig` file for your cart.

## New Camera

We're starting to include new Sony PTZ cameras this year! Your AV setup will include 1 [Sony PTZ camera](https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/ptz-network-cameras/srg-a40) and 1 PTZ Optics camera. The PTZ Optics camera is the same one as in previous years.

One particularly notable feature that can make your life easier in opening ceremonies is auto tracking, which can be configured in the web interface. More info can be found in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsSU9sPqYhg).

| Camera     | IP Address    |
|------------|---------------|
| Sony       | 192.168.25.x1 |
| PTZ Optics | 192.168.25.x2 |

Where `x` is your cart number.

## vMix Upgraded

In the offseason, we upgraded vMix on all the AV carts to version 28. The company behind vMix has a post about all of the new major features [on their blog](https://blog.vmix.com/vmix-28-is-available-now/).

## And More

We're always improving the AV volunteer experience, both during the season and in the off-season. There may be some additional small changes to equipment or tools.
