# Google Drive Layout

All of the content that you need for your event can be found in our FiM-AV Shared Google Drive. This will be on the AV cart under the `G:` drive, then `Shared Drives`, then `FiM-AV`. If you don't see the `G:` drive, follow the steps on [Google Drive not Syncing](../troubleshooting-guides/drive-not-syncing). Below you can find a description of what's in each folder:

- **Cart Setup**: Templates used in every event and tools to set up new carts
  - **vMix**: vMix Templates. Use the one that starts with `COPY_THIS_ONE` as a good starting point for your event, just copy it to your event-specific folder
  - **StreamDeck**: Our recommended StreamDeck configurations
  - **XR18-FRC-Default.scn**: Our recommended configuration for the audio mixer
- **FRC**: Everything related to FRC events
  - **Events-2024**: Content related to a specific event, every Michigan event has its own folder
    - _You'll want to look in here for your event's sponsor slideshow, which should be played between each match._
  - **FiM Official Media**: Content created by *FIRST* in Michigan
    - **vMix Graphics Package**: Branded graphics elements that fit in with FRC events and can be used in your production, simply drag them into vMix
  - **FIRST Official Media**: Content created by *FIRST*. This folder contains nearly everything called for in your event script
    - **Music and Sound**: Guidelines for DJs and pre-cut music beds for the awards ceremony (optional)
    - **Videos**: When you're looking for something mentioned in your event script, this is the first folder to check
      - **FIRST_Sponsor_video_2024_with_captions.mp4**: Embed this video into your event-specific sponsor slideshow before exporting as a video
- **FTC**: Everything related to FTC events
