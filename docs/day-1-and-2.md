## The Night Before Each Opening Ceremony

- Find your Event Coordinator
  - Ask for the finalized version of the script (if you don't already have it)
  - Ask if there is anything about the plan for opening ceremony that you should know about
  - If there's a performer for the national anthem, coordinate a time that the performer should do a quick mic check with you
- Check all videos in the script
  - Sit down at the AV cart and go through the script, we recommend highlighting or circling any videos so they're easy to see
  - As you come across each video, find it in Google Drive and drag it in to vMix. Check that it plays
  - If there is a performer for the national anthem, be sure to **turn off sound** for the American flag video
  - If you can't find any videos, reach out to the {% include slack-av-help.md %}
- Save your vMix config

- If there's a performer for the national anthem, do a mic check with them
  - Have them sing a few bars, make sure their volume is not too high or too low, write down that level so you can easily get back to it once the opening ceremony is in progress
