# Pit Displays

{: .note }
The current URL for FiM Queueing is <https://q.fimav.us>

## Setting up

Your AV cart should have received a DM containing instructions setting up your pit displays as well as the event key to use for FiM Queueing. If you did not receive an event key please request assistance in the #av-private channel in Slack from your AV cart.

Pit displays no longer require a direct connection to the field's network, it also does not require any special software running on the AV cart. The only requirement is that FMS running in online mode and syncing data. Simply go to the URL above and use your event key, and data will update from the cloud.

## One TV

The current recommendation with 1 TV available in the pits is to utilize the FiM queueing display with the following setup:

| TV # | Qualifications                         | Playoffs                            |
|-----:|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | Qualification Queueing (with Rankings) | Playoff Queueing or Playoff Bracket |

Click start to finish setup of the display.

## Two TVs

The current recommendation with 2 TVs available in the pits is to display different information on each of them:

| TV # | Qualifications                   | Playoffs         |
|-----:|----------------------------------|------------------|
| 1    | Qualification queueing           | Playoff Queueing |
| 2    | FRC Pit Display or Team Rankings | Playoff Bracket  |

Click start to finish setup of the display.

## Other Setups

Ultimately what you put on each of these displays is up to you. If your pit admin staff or queuers have other requests for these screens you're free to show those instead. FiM Queueing provides quick access to the commonly used pages shown, but any page can be pulled up in Chrome.
