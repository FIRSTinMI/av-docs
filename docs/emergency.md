# Emergency Procedures

{: .note }
Emergencies can be divided into two types; serious technical issues, or situations which pose a danger to people in the event (such as severe weather or a fire). This page only covers the second type of emergency.

An emergency is a rare occurrence, and while it's unlikely you will encounter one during your event, it's still helpful to have a reference of what to do.

This document covers steps that are applicable for many situations, but use your best judgement of what is right for your situation.

1. **Work with your Event Coordinator.** The Event Coordinator is charged with managing emergencies, and they will be the most familiar with the venue and event's specific emergency preparedness documents. Let them choose what information should be relayed to the audience and who should relay that information.
2. **Work with your FTAs.** If your Event Coordinator is not nearby, the FTAs will be able to get in touch with them over radio. Things may be chaotic in an emergency situation and people will be busy, just do whatever you can to help.
3. **Mute all audio except for microphones.** Game sounds, music, or other audio in the venue can make it harder to hear instructions.
4. **Keep yourself safe.** Your safety and the safety of everyone else is the priority. Make sure the information everyone needs to know has been shared and get yourself to a safe place.
5. **Be aware of what you're streaming.** Consider what is being broadcast to the internet. If necessary, utilize the FTB (Fade to Black) button in vMix or stop your stream entirely.
6. As the situation progresses, management of the emergency may be passed from the Event Coordinator to local emergency services. Continue to provide any assistance they need in getting announcements out.
