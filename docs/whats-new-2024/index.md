# What&apos;s New in 2024
{: .no_toc }

## Cameras and Packing

The setup is pretty much the same this year as last year, with a few minor changes:

- All cameras now support NDI, this means you only need to run one cable (the blue Ethernet cable) to each camera
- Pit display computers have been replaced with newer hardware. There is one provided for each trailer
- There's a new 27" monitor for AV. It's easy to assemble and disassemble without tools, the monitor's base can be stored inside the AV cart above the drawer
- We've upgraded some of the components inside of the AV servers, which will alleviate the minor performance bottlenecks found in the 2023 season
- We've consolidated to one gray tote, down from the 2 we've previously had

## Pit Displays

FiM's custom pit displays are largely unchanged for the 2024 season. They have been updated to reflect the new break schedule in the playoffs.

## Stream Graphics

FiM's stream graphics solution has gained more functionality this season, allowing you to change the graphics on the fly without needing to do anything inside of vMix. Simply add a web browser input with the following URL:

`https://q.fimav.us/overlay?key=YOURKEYHERE` where "YOURKEYHERE" is the same event key you use to set up the pit displays.

A page has been added to allow management of these graphics, where you can make as many changes as you want, and they'll all go live at once when "apply" is clicked. All official FiM AV Google accounts have access to this functionality (which are already signed in on the carts), if you want your personal account to have permission for your specific event, please request it in #av-private in Slack.

The management interface can be found at `https://q.fimav.us/manage/options`.

Additional improvements to the stream graphics are expected to come throughout the season.

## AV Assistant

A new application is being added to the AV carts this season, which we're calling "AV Assistant". As the project grows, it'll help you go through the event setup process step-by-step. In its current form, it allows AV leads to send time-sensitive alerts directly to your cart, and provides some helpful data to make troubleshooting issues easier.


## And More

We're always improving the AV volunteer experience, both during the season and off-season. There may be some additional small changes to equipment or tools.
