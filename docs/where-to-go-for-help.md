# Where To Go for Help

Per the *FIRST* Role Description, the AV volunteer reports to the Event Coordinator (EC), but you can get help for some things from other people at the event or on Slack.

For technical questions with the AV cart or any software on it, talk to someone in the **#av-help channel on Slack**.

For issues with Audience Display not showing the correct information or issues with FMS (the server that runs the field), talk to your ***FIRST* Technical Advisor (FTA)**.

For questions about whether/where you can set up equipment (like cameras) near the field, talk to your **field supervisor**.

For questions about AV which may affect match play, such as how audible game sounds are or changing lighting conditions, talk to your ***FIRST* Technical Advisor (FTA)**.

For venue-specific questions, like where to plug in ethernet or sound, or where to put the projector, talk to your **Event Coordinator (EC)**.

Feeling like you need an extra hand? Talk to your **Volunteer Coordinator (VC)**, they might have someone in mind who can help you out.

For any other questions, reach out to the **#av-help channel on Slack** and we can point you in the right direction. Keep in mind that every event is a little different so the first person that you ask may not have all the answers, you can always fall back to Slack where a larger group will see your question and be able to chime in.
