This document lists the needed AV tasks to ready the equipment needed for a FIRST in Michigan FRC district competition. The startup of the AV computer and its tasks can be found in [Setting Up the FiM AV System](../setting-up-the-fim-av-system). 
 
## Field – Main Gym 
 
### AV Cart Location

Discuss/confirm location of AV cart and Field system with FTA. Typically, it is placed at the middle point of the field. The AV cart and Field cart are placed with a small walkway between them. 

### Internet Connection

Locate the internet connection to be used. If the venue has not supplied an ethernet cable to the scoring table, run a cable from the jack as needed. Consult with FTA and Lead Queuing as needed to consider cable paths. Connect the cable to port 1 of the AV cart switch. 
 
### Power

Connect the AV cart to power on a separate circuit from the FIRST field.
 
### Screen

Screen assembly and location vary by venue. In many cases, it will be done by the rental company and/or venue employees. In a few cases you will need to assemble the screen (or supervise it). A frame is assembled, then the screen is snapped to it much like a truck cover. It should be flown (hung from the ceiling). 
 
{: .note }
White is for front projection. Grey is for rear projections. The screens have been found in mislabeled bags in the past. 
 
### Projector

The projector is a minimum 12000 lumens with a short throw lens. SDI input is preferred as this is what the AV cart supplies. Converter boxes may be used as needed. The projector should be flown. In many venues, an elevated track runs around the outside walls. The projector can be placed on a high cart on either short end in this case. At many events the rental company handles the setup of the projector. Verify with the Event Coordinator. Connect the coax for the projector to the mini converter in the back of the AV cart. 
 
### Field Sound

The AV cart has a mixer and 2 wireless mics. Use the Main L output to feed the venue or rented sound system. A long XLR cable is located in AV Tote 2. 
 
### Camera

There are 2 cameras with the FiM AV system – both PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom). Your field may also have a fixed-view 120 degree camera. The PTZ cameras can be controlled in vMix. The FIRST standard main view (refer to FIRST documentation produced in 1/2020) during the matches specifies a long view of the entire field with the scoring graphic on the bottom third (moving to the top third is optional). A camera should be positioned mid-field, back far enough to capture the whole field. Many times this is a tripod positioned at the top of the bleachers. Secure as needed. A mounting arm is also provided for use if you are _safely_ able to do so.

The cameras need 2 cables ran to them, one coax for video and one ethernet for power and remote control. There are 
150 foot spools in AV Tote 2. Connect the camera coax video to the patch panel in the back of the AV cart (labeled inputs). Connect the camera ethernet to the network switch in the back of the AV cart ports 5 and 6.

A network diagram PDF document can be found on the Windows desktop of the AV computer.  
 
 
## Pit Area  - Aux Gym 
 
### Audio 

In most venues, the pit area has a PA system and mic that can be used for pit area announcements. Verify with your Event Coordinator. A small rental or donated PA can be used. Powered speakers with a wireless mic are a good option. 
 
### Network Connection 
The Pit Display(s) need a network connection. A connected laptop at the Pit Admin table is very helpful as they can monitor the queueing needed by viewing the match live stream. 
 
### Pit and Queueing Display
A large screen display or projector is setup for the Pit and Queueing displays. This is typically near Pit Admin and Inspection. Connect the network cable to a computer from the AV totes or a laptop, or connect to the venue's wifi if a hardwired connection is not available. Refer to [Pit Display Setup](../pit-displays) for more information on setting up the displays.
