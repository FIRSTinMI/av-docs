# New AV Cart Setup
This section will include all of the documentation and guides for setting up a new AV Cart.  This includes setting up the network, installing software, and configuring the cart.

{: .note }
Most of the drivers for the AV Cart are installed automatically.  These take time and require an internet connection. If you are installing windows, you may access the internet through the auxillary NIC (PCIe NIC Card) on the back of the cart.  If these drivers don't install automatically, open windows update and check for updates.  Graphics drivers,
chipset drivers, and other drivers will be installed automatically.  Please be patient!

## Required Software
The following software is required to be installed on the AV Cart.  If you are setting up a new cart, you will need to install this software.  If you are updating an existing cart, you may need to update some of this software.  The majority of this software can be installed from the G drive.  If you are unable to access the G drive, you can download the software from the links provided.

1. Use [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) to install the base software.
