# No Signal to Projector

## Check settings in NVIDIA Control Panel

Make sure to select the 1080p option under "Ultra HD, HD, SD" with a 30Hz refresh rate. The converter on the projector end is very picky about settings.

## Try plugging the SDI into a camera

Give a camera power and plug the SDI in. If the projector shows the camera feed you can rule out the cable or the converter on the projector end.
