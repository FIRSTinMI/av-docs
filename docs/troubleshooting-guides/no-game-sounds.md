# No Game Sounds

If you don't have any game sounds:

1. Check that the audio output set inside of Audience Display is the Windows default device
2. Run through the AV Assistant setup to ensure your Windows audio settings are correct
3. Watch the green bar in x-air to see if sound is making it to the audio mixer
